Zero Waste Fashion aims to increase awareness of the best ways to recycle, reuse, repair and upcycle clothing and textiles in Leeds.

It is a collaborative project, developed by [Zero Waste Leeds](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/), the [School of Design](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/design/staff/458/dr-pammi-sinha) at the University of Leeds and [Leeds City Council](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling) and funded by the [Economic and Social Research Council](https://esrc.ukri.org/).

One key area of work is around understanding what people currently do with clothing that they no longer need. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to donate clothing that’s still in good condition - and we also want to make sure that people know what their options are for disposing of clothing that’s no longer in good condition.

We have developed a [Zero Waste Fashion website](https://zerowastefashion.fashion.blog/) with tips on where to recycle, reuse, repair and upcycle clothing and textiles in Leeds, including a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?hl=en&mid=18ktKdUeew3oQpjOnezeTyLtt9pk1KK7w&ll=53.83676365656107%2C-1.5013154999999188&z=11) of all the textile banks, charity shops, repair shops, sewing classes and clothes exchanges in Leeds.

We are planning a **Zero Waste Fashion Hack** on the 31st March 2020 at the University of Leeds, and are organising a **Zero Waste Fashion Week** (17th-25th April 2020), exploring the following themes: 

<br>- Sharing practical ways for people in Leeds to manage the impacts of their clothing choices;

\- Exploring reasons why sustainability in fashion is so important;

\- Celebrating the rich textile heritage of Leeds, and

\- Building a #ZeroWasteFashion movement.
