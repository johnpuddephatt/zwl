We have recently started a project working with the [School of Design](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/design/staff/458/dr-pammi-sinha) at the University of Leeds and [Leeds City Council,](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling) looking at issues around textiles, clothing and fashion.

One key area of work is around understanding what people currently do with clothing that they no longer need. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to donate clothing that’s still in good condition - and we also want to make sure that people know what their options are for disposing of clothing that’s no longer in good condition.

For starters, we have developed a Zero Waste Fashion [website](https://zerowastefashion.fashion.blog/) with tips on where to recycle, reuse, repair and upcycle clothing and textiles in Leeds. This includes a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?hl=en&mid=18ktKdUeew3oQpjOnezeTyLtt9pk1KK7w&ll=53.83676365656107%2C-1.5013154999999188&z=11) of all the textile banks, charity shops, repair shops, sewing classes and clothes exchanges in Leeds. If you spot any places we have missed or have any ideas for the site please [get in touch](rob@zerowasteleeds.org.uk)!

We are also planning to host a Zero Waste Fashion hack in the Spring, where we will explore a range of practical ways that we can work together in our city to reduce the environmental impacts of the clothes we wear.  

We are meeting on January 14th for a couple of hours in the centre of Leeds to explore ideas - if this is an issue you’re interested in we’d love to see you there - [please sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/zero-waste-fashion-hack-planning-tickets-85799272935).  

If you’d like to chat more about this project, or have ideas on how we can expand our work on fashion and clothing, please [contact us](mailto:rob@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).
