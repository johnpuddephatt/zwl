Over the last couple of days Leeds City Council has announced plans for reopening Household Waste Sites, and re-starting brown bin (garden waste) collections.

We have shared short video updates below.  In summary, they are intending to open some of the sites, with an online booking system in place, at some stage during week commencing 11 May.  There will be extended opening hours, from 8am to 8pm.  More details, including opening dates and which sites will be open, will be shared later this week.  Here's the update on Household Waste Sites:

The Council has also announced that brown bin collections are due to start again week commencing 25 May.  Collection days may change - but they will write to householders to let them know more.  They have also announced that a limited service offering free bulky waste collections will start up from 18 May - focusing in particular on people who are self-isolating or shielding.
