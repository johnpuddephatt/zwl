4000 tonnes of clothing and textiles end up in Leeds' black bins every year. [Zero Waste Fashion week](https://zerowastefashion.fashion.blog/fashion-week/) will be a series of events to celebrate the rich textile, fashion and clothing history of Leeds and explore how we can lead the world again but in a more sustainable way.

The week will take place from Friday 17th April to 24th 2020 and will be a series of events at different venues across Leeds that aim to: 

\- Share **practical** ways for people in Leeds to manage the impacts of their clothing choices

\- Explore reasons why **sustainability** in fashion is so important

\- Celebrate the rich textile **heritage** of Leeds

\- Build a #ZeroWasteFashion movement

We will be hosting a couple of our own events during the week, and are also looking for other people that would be interested in hosting their own events, which we will promote. We have started scheduling events for the week on the dedicated fashion week [webpage]([zerowastefashion.fashion.blog/fashion-week](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fzerowastefashion.fashion.blog%2Ffashion-week%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2R_gC7noDbRxvj5iQNfOYS7hjXTvirJRz1QVxCKhE9-p3GIxQe0ax7nFo&h=AT2QQnrc8bbhQbBk9Hy_eWdFayXlnYZURZcH-udM9Bt_ckVt3fL27ND5HqmQvPnp-LC3UMIk3lc42zVEjhxRivV_d6u343id7BM-3tqYsFezqzv99FrMq0n0s20FS5CXc9JADoEgn0Ol7k9bmYbNBk3I5j2pYX5-TWQSkuxM3qsMhqnLfbO8aMmyucob0soh-QWNLHEGM8fb2h3Cu5t0alZ8_uH6G1G_3FvWIJ1FkVn8tfhAG7D601oGX_jc52uXAJTaxBiEbR5elSaYWk-ye6064j3g2VhT-RGu05uDeM_7v-7na-kpCal2u2YVwI3kzzmWXrNc6egIzJHFwgbWwLstnn7jyhm6OpaBZ1ZmSiFUFOl0jokG1Hv0lwBtIiOXLKQlAaN6VkaQpFKnt5f7Kvho2EJF_5IkhH1ypiTIwnuH9ObTvSgJ2zjBIsPCxVMo6gqRVRdHdYgDePsTw6_aKXZnE5xb_Wd0B9GWrjWXQ1dXvDTVvKkSLLnZ8MBf1F8TZ5ZKp-0p4ULfw5zs1rEwZQQsry4_C4ycvSboBvb9sAg5Mh7wpDgHrnPRZwRl2qrXmgv4GhB1E7X8VpII7EC4ZfLjV2F5p0-a2djiGs_9FBFWtnuc3KUIhZcw9haqHCfEDiSOAG8HG3W2SoQTBrY)) but are still working to finalise the details and will have more information soon.
