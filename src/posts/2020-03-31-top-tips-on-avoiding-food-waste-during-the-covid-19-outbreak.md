Check what you already have in - Have a rummage through your fridge, freezer and cupboards. Tidy them up, and make a list of what’s in there.

Come up with a meal plan - Based on what’s in your cupboards, fridge and freezer, make a plan for the week’s meals. There are loads of ideas online from people like Jack Monroe and Jamie Oliver.

Make a shopping list - With all of us being asked to limit our shopping and only shop for essentials, it helps more than ever to shop from a list. Only buy what you need and eat what you buy.

Compost food scraps - If you have one, use your compost heap for uncooked fruit and vegetable scraps. If not, now is a perfect time to start one! We have more tips on how to start a compost heap on our website.
