We’ve recently started a project working with the [School of Design](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/design/staff/458/dr-pammi-sinha) at the University of Leeds and [Leeds City Council,](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling) looking at issues around textiles, clothing and fashion.

One key area of work is around understanding what people currently do with clothing that they no longer need.  We want to make it as easy as possible for people to donate clothing that’s still in good condition - and we also want to make sure that people know what their options are for disposing of clothing that’s no longer in good condition.

For starters, we’re mapping all the charity shops and textile banks in the city - you can see this map [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=18ktKdUeew3oQpjOnezeTyLtt9pk1KK7w&ll=53.838527033496796%2C-1.5013154999999188&z=11&fbclid=IwAR1uESVAyVLfspcawFg9R6ZviswH7Nz9uH0DdeZfI9O45rTSWVnlqL-Rw6Y).  We still need to pull together information on textile banks run by charities - so if you work for a charity than runs textile banks - or if you know there’s a bank near you that’s not on our map, [please get in touch](mailto:rob@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).  

We are also planning to host a zero waste fashion hack in the Spring, where we’ll explore a range of practical ways that we can work together in our city to reduce the environmental impacts of the clothes we wear.  

We’re meeting on January 14th for a couple of hours in the centre of Leeds to explore ideas - if this is an issue you’re interested in we’d love to see you there - [please sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/zero-waste-fashion-hack-planning-tickets-85799272935).  

If you’d like to chat more about this project, or have ideas on how we can expand our work on fashion and clothing, please [contact us](mailto:rob@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).
