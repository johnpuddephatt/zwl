With support from [Hubbub](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/), and in collaboration with TK Maxx and Homesense, we are working on an exciting project called [Plastic Pioneers](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/plastic-pioneers) with [Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School](https://www.cardinalheenan.com/pages/news/89622) in Meanwood.

Cardinal Heenan are one of 12 trail blazing schools to have joined Plastic Pioneers which encourages students and staff to re-think school life with less single-use plastic. 

We’ve been working with a group of students at the school, who’ve formed a Plastic Pioneers lunchtime group to take a lead on reducing the amount of single-use plastic. 

We helped them to come up with an action plan - and they've done a range of things already, including encouraging students to bring water bottles to school, to be topped up at water fountains - rather than buying bottles of water.  

They’ve also been [working with the school’s caterers](https://twitter.com/CHCHSLeeds/status/1197500108461498368) to reduce the amount of single-use plastic that’s available in the canteen, and [organised a litter pick](https://twitter.com/CHCHSLeeds/status/1195679315041619968?s=20) in their local community.  

To help improve people’s understanding of the issues, and to inspire people to do more, they invited [artists and inspirational speakers](https://twitter.com/CHCHSLeeds/status/1197499830765010944?s=20) into school. 

We'll continue to work with Cardinal Heenan during 2020 - and we’d also like to do more work in the future with schools in Leeds.
