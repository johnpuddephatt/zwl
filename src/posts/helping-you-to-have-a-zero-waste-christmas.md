Christmas can be a time when so much gets wasted or thrown away - but it doesn't need to be that way!

We've been working on a really exciting project with local TV production company [True North](https://www.truenorth.tv/), to produce a series of [twelve short films](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD4AOnL4OuGUnxHqDi_5ghQ/videos?view_as=public) on the theme of a Zero Waste Christmas.

The films feature many of the fantastic small businesses, social enterprises and community groups in Leeds that are making it easier than ever for us to have a fun, but less wasteful, Christmas. 

We're sharing one film a day in the run up to Christmas, and so far we've had films about [Christmas crackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvi56N-onJM), making your own [decorations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuOFYE0sxtI&t=29s), how to avoid [giving gifts that no-one wants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB81ZlGAijo), and that classic amongst Christmas gifts - [the bicycle (but refurbished of course)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ-BXnBHUlk).

You can see each of the films as they come out by [following us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/), or by subscribing to [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcImqkHEpk0pB_bvCe8dLyhwYma2pn3zg).

We are SO grateful for the time and expertise that the team at [True North](https://www.truenorth.tv/) have so generously offered to this project - and we hope you like the films as much as we do!
