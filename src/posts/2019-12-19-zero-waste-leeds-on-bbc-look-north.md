For the second time in a month, Zero Waste Leeds were invited onto BBC Look North - this time to talk about our #ZeroWasteChristmas campaign.

We have worked with local TV production company [True North](https://www.truenorth.tv/) to create [a series of twelve short films](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcImqkHEpk0pB_bvCe8dLyhwYma2pn3zg) which showcase lots of the fantastic opportunities that exist in Leeds to help us all to have fun, but less wasteful, celebrations over the Christmas period.

[Gill chatted with Amy and Harry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjW-naPrPs&list=PLcImqkHEpk0pDsTaCJj5W-HwD7-3SDQ3I&index=2&t=0s) about the campaign, and offered some top tips for a zero waste Christmas.  She also talked them through how she'd made the Christmas jumper she was wearing - sewing 20 year old tinsel onto one of her favourite jumpers - tinsel that can be easily removed once the festive season is over.  

You can see [the 3 minute interview with Gill on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjW-naPrPs&list=PLcImqkHEpk0pDsTaCJj5W-HwD7-3SDQ3I&index=2&t=0s), alongside the [feature by Hannah Gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHPiKOb8q3U&feature=youtu.be) - where she visited [SCRAP](https://www.scrapstuff.co.uk/) in Farsley and [The Greenhouse](https://www.thegreenhousehorsforth.co.uk/) in Horsforth.  You will also find there [our series of #ZeroWasteChristmas films](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcImqkHEpk0pB_bvCe8dLyhwYma2pn3zg).
