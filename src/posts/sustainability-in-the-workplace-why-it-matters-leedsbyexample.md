The success of #LeedsbyExample city centre on-the-go recycling was incredible. Recycling rates in the city nearly tripled from 17% to 49% and it’s being used as the template for other UK cities.

So where do we go from here? Our next step is into the business community. In a city with over 6,000 small and medium-size businesses, well above the national average and a workforce of over 1.3 million, it makes sense for us to do this.

Sustainability is moving higher and higher up the business agenda. A recent survey by Lloyds Bank stated that almost two thirds (64%) of small and medium-sized business owners want to improve their environmental sustainability, with economic savings being the main motivation for doing so. 

Other reasons include changing regulations such as the government’s target to be net zero by 2050 - the business sector contributed 18% of carbon emissions in the UK in 2018. The ability to attract younger customers and employees who have grown up with an increased awareness about sustainability and an expectation that companies will reflect this is another. For these people the difference between an organisation that is environmentally aware or not can be the deciding factor on where they choose to work or shop. 

More and more companies are seeing the benefits of being ISO14001 accredited* too – a badge of environmental honour in the business community.

Our motivation remains the same to share useful and positive ways that inspire people to live and work in a more sustainable way. It’s good for heath and wellbeing and for our city, and the future of our planet. It just makes sense.

Our aim is to replicate the success of #LeedsbyExample on-the-go recycling to all aspects of environmental sustainability in the workplace from supply chain/procurement, energy and water to travel, catering, waste and recycling.

From this month, we’ll be out visiting businesses across Leeds. We’re already working with Direct Line Insurance, True North TV, Hays Recruitment, Bruntwood and others.
