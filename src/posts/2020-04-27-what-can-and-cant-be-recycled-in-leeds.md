If you've ever spent longer than necessary wondering whether the margarine tub, orange juice carton or crisp packet in your hand is recyclable or not, then you're definitely not alone. A study carried out a couple of years ago in the UK revealed that over 56% of people are confused about what can and can't be recycled which inevitably leads many to just give up.

On Wednesday 29th April, we're going to be joined by recycling expert Kathryn Irish from Leeds Recycles at 1pm for a [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/events/158759045540356/?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%22[%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22page%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22page_upcoming_events_card%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A[]%7D]%22%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D) to answer all your recycling questions. You can [send them to us in advance](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk) or ask them direct to Kathryn during the Live Q&A.
