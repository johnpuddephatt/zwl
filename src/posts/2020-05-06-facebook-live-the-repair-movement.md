Today we hosted a Facebook Live Q & A about all things to do with repair.

We were joined by [Ed Carlisle](https://twitter.com/edleeds?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) - one of the people behind [Leeds Repair Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252645815067316/), [Jenny Whisker](https://twitter.com/jennywhisker?lang=en), who amongst many other things runs [The Sewing Kind](https://www.facebook.com/groups/632679410164961/), and [Dave Prince](https://twitter.com/1dayallofthis), who runs the [Bike Hub at Leeds Beckett University](https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/news/0519-collaborative-bike-hub-celebrates-10-years-of-getting-people-cycling/).

We spoke about how the current situation has given a renewed focus to repair - for some very practical reasons.  During lockdown it's been harder to buy new things - or to find people to fix things for us.  So repairing things yourself has suddenly become more important.

And we explored the idea of time - and how many of us currently have more time on our hands.  Repairing something will often take time - particularly the first time you do something - but the current lockdown situation has given a lot of people a bit more time to work out how to fix things.

We also spoke about the generosity that exists within what you might call the "repair movement" - the fact that people are keen to help others to learn new skills.  And about how repairing something can give you a stronger emotional attachment to something like an item of clothing.  You're more likely to keep hold of that item longer - and that obviously has big environmental benefits.  

We plan to do more on repair over the coming weeks - if you have any ideas for anything we could do, please let us know.  

In the meantime, please do follow [Leeds Repair Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252645815067316/), and [The Sewing Kind](https://twitter.com/thesewingkind).  And we'd like to say a big thank you to Dave, Ed, and Jenny fo sharing their skills and enthusiasm with us.
