During the current Covid-19 outbreak, we are pausing the rest of our work and focusing on supporting the Council in communicating changes to bin collections, recycling and waste management.

To keep in touch with any changes to your bin collections, please visit [the Council's website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling).  You can also keep up to date by following the Council's Leeds Recycles accounts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leedsrecycles) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LeedsRecycles/).  

You can also sign up for an email alert when there are any changes to bin collections - [here on the Council website](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKLEEDS/subscriber/new?topic_id=UKLEEDS_3).  

We will also be sharing Council updates, and sharing other relevant news on our social media - please follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zerowasteleeds) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowasteleeds/).  

We'll also be posting regular video updates on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z1XbKQe5I0&list=PLcImqkHEpk0q4hYF9BzvWl4wsX6illXyD).  

The hashtag #LeedsBins will be used for updates to bin collection services in Leeds.

Alongside sharing important information about services, we will also be sharing lots of waste reduction tips and ideas over the coming weeks.  

With more of us spending much more time at home over the coming weeks, we are likely to produce a lot more recyclable and non-recyclable waste.  

We can all play our part in managing our waste and recycling as best we can - and we'll be sharing tips and ideas on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, with the #binittogether hashtag.
