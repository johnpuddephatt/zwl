Leeds By Example, the on-the-go recycling project on which Zero Waste Leeds were a local partner, was recently the lead story on BBC Look North - you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtYP-N1x65c&list=PLcImqkHEpk0rJ9nHXXNnN-zgIvOT4xPEh).  

Zero Waste Leeds co-director Rob Greenland joined Keeley Donovan and Phil Bodmer on the BBC Look North sofa to talk about the success of the project - which is now being rolled out to two other cities.
