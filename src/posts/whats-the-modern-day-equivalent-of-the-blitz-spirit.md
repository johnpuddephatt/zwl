Dr Henry Irving, a historian at Leeds Beckett University talks with local journalist Peg Alexander about what we can - and perhaps can't - learn from how local communities responded and came together during World War 2. 

Zero Waste Leeds recently worked with Henry on a project exploring one of his research interests - recycling and reuse in Leeds during World War 2. What can we learn from what happened then - in terms of managing our waste over the coming weeks?
