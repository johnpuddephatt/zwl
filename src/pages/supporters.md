We’re building a movement to help make Leeds a zero waste city by 2030.  We do this by starting conversations, listening to and sharing people’s ideas, and testing new solutions.

We inhabit the space between local government, business, education, communities and individuals who want to work with us to create a more sustainable way of life.  Our aim is to inspire more people to waste less and reuse and recycle more.

You can find out more about who we work with below.
