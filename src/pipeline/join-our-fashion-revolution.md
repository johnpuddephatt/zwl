We'd like your help to explore what we can do reduce the environmental impacts of our wardrobes. We're hosting a [\#FashionHack](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%23fashionhack&epa=SEARCH_BOX) this Spring, an event bringing together industry experts and interested people to kickstart a conversation around #ZeroWasteFashion in Leeds.

There's a planning meeting on 14 January 2020 at 5.30pm for a couple of hours to explore ideas and make sure the event is a big success. If you're interested in sustainable fashion, then we'd love to see you there. You can [sign up](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/zero-waste-fashion-hack-planning-tickets-85799272935) for a place here.

A staggering £60.5bn was spent by UK households on clothing in 2018; 336,000 tonnes of it ended up in household waste in 2017; 10% increase in the amount of clothing thrown away. These are just some of the figures in waste reduction charity [WRAP's recent report ](https://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Textiles%20market%20situation%20report%202019.pdf)on sustainable clothing.
