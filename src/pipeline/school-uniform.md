Many families in Leeds struggle to afford new school uniforms for their children.

And then there's the environmental cost of lots of perfectly good uniforms that end up getting thrown away - either by the school, who are left with a mountain of lost property - or by parents themselves.

So we'd like to do what we can to make it easier for people to offer up uniforms for reuse - and to get second hand uniforms themselves.

But as always, we want to work with other people to do this.  It's the kind of thing that works best at a very local level - at a school, amongst parents. Local people getting together to do things - like [Education Aid](https://www.facebook.com/EducationAid18) in Leeds.

In some ways it's a pretty simple issue to solve - but it's clear that for a whole host of practical reasons, far too much good quality uniform currently gets thrown away. That's such a waste - particularly when reuse could have big benefits for people living in poverty in our city. And the environmental impacts of throwing away so much clothing (much of which is polyester - made from petrochemicals) - are huge.

So if this is an issue you're involved with - or would like to be - please visit our [Leeds School Uniform Reuse Exchange group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854/permalink/605410550091519/?notif_id=1593425728610333&notif_t=group_description_change) on Facebook and add your thoughts, comments and ideas. Or alternatively please comment below or [email us](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).

Wouldn't it be great if in 5 years time reusing school uniforms was a normal - and easy thing to do in Leeds?
