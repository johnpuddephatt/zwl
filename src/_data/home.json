    "description": "\\#LeedsByExample on-the-go recycling is back! In lockdown we focused on [StayAtHome waste reduction](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/how-can-we-build-back-better-together/) but as the city starts to open up again, we're back promoting and sharing the benefits of recycling coffee cups, cans and plastic bottles.  \n\nWhen it comes to on-the-go recycling [Leeds truly leads the way](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leedsbyexample-on-the-go-recycling/), recycling rates tripled from 17% to 49% and it is being rolled out to other cities across the UK.  We'll be building on that success, as well as adapting our work to reflect these uncertain times by providing practical support to people and businesses to help them waste less.   \n\nLook out for regular updates on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeroWasteLeeds) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowasteleeds/)."
