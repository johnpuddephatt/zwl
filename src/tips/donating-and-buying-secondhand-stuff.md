With so many options to buy and donate secondhand stuff in Leeds, there's really very little need to buy new! Many reuse organisations in Leeds are run by charities or social enterprises, so by buying from them, not only are you saving precious environmental resources, but you are also often supporting a really good cause.

We have listed all the reuse options we know in Leeds below. Please [get in touch](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk) if we have missed any.

\*NB: When donating your secondhand stuff, please consider the quality of your items. If it needs more than a minor repair or a light clean, chances are these organisations won't be able to accept it. Lots of furniture items like sofas, chairs and beds must also carry fire safety labels. All electrical items should be free from rust, be reasonably clean, have intact seals and ideally be in full working order. Many of these organisations can collect bulky re-usable items from your home for free - check on their websites.
