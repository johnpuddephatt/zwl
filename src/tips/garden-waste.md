**What is garden waste?**

This is the waste that you generate in your garden such as grass clippings, weeds, prunings, dead plants, leaves and twigs. When thinking about compost it can also include some kitchen waste like veg peelings, tea leaves, coffee grounds and fruit. All of this will end up in your brown or black bins unless you compost that waste in your garden. What we'll talk about here is how to divert that waste from your bins into a really beneficial product that will enrich your garden.

**What is compost?**

Compost is decomposed or recycled organic matter (plants, grass clippings, kitchen waste and cardboard for example) that has broken down into a rich, moist, crumbly, dark brown and earthy material that can be used in the garden. It’s full of nutrients and adds goodness back into your soil to feed your plants.

**Why is it important**

Most of your brown bin contents can be composted, but did you know that a lot of what goes in our black bins can be composted at home as well? If we can stop that going into the bin then it doesn’t have to be transported and it doesn’t have to be sent to landfill or an incinerator. That means less energy used and fewer emissions. The big plus for you though is you retain all of that goodness in your garden and can feed your plants for free.

**How to make compost**

There’s a whole range of things that can be composted and they break down into two groups - browns and greens. Browns are things like cardboard, egg boxes, straw, hay, shredded paper, twigs, woody stems and bark/woodchip, they tend to be drier and contain lots of carbon. Greens are grass clippings, leafy or soft plant growth, veg peelings, tea leaves, coffee grounds and fruit, they tend to be wet and contain lots of nitrogen. Greens provide the moisture and energy for the bacteria (where you get the heat) and browns provide the structure and air, you want about a 50:50 mix of each.

Normal compost heaps don’t contain raw or cooked meat, dairy, bread, cooked kitchen waste, though you can compost these in some of the more advanced systems. No heap should ever contain faeces from meat eating animals such as cats and dogs, though it is fine to put used bedding from rabbits and other rodents in (they’re a good source of browns).

Another thing you can add to it that might seem slightly unusual is human wee, people have been adding wee to compost heaps for years. It’s full of nitrogen and other trace elements such as potassium and phosphorous and is really beneficial for you garden, it also saves what is essentially fertiliser being flushed down the toilet and wasted (and treated, which requires lots of energy).

**What do you do with it and when will it be ready**

Compost from your heap or bin has several uses, it can be added to your soil as a surface mulch which helps retain moisture and slowly adds nutrients. You can also dig it in to your soil as a conditioner. Really mature, fine and crumbly compost can be used for potting or for sowing seeds.

Everyone’s compost matures at different rates and will depend on type of bin, size of heap, mix of materials, turning/aeration, time of year and location in the garden primarily. A slow heap over winter can take 6 months to mature, well managed heaps in summer can produce usable compost in about 6 weeks.

All good things come to those who wait. Your heap is ready when it is uniformly dark brown or black in colour, has an earthy smell and the contents have broken down into smaller parts. At this point you may still have some larger lumps and the overall texture isn’t fine and crumbly, this is best used as either a mulch in flower or veg beds or mixed into your soil. If you’re prepared to wait a little longer and let the worms really go to town then you’ll get what gardeners refer to as black gold, the finer textured crumbly compost similar to what you might buy from a garden centre. You can still use this as a mulch but now it will also work really well in pots or containers and you can use it for growing seeds (mix in a little sand, soil, fine grit, leaf mould or vermiculite to get the texture you want).

**Getting started**

The best way to make compost is by using a bin, this provides a structure to keep it all in one place which in turn ensures that it gets hot enough to start working. You can make your own bin but the vast majority of us buy one of the huge range that are available, the only requirement being that it’s big enough to take the waste and have sufficient volume to generate the heat and activity - a standard square bin is 1mx1mx1m.

Wooden slatted kit bins are cheap and easy to assemble, even better if you get one that has removable slats at the front as they make mixing and turning much easier and take the strain off your back.

Black or green plastic “Dalek” bins are also cheap and require no assembly, they come with lids which can help with managing moisture in your heap. Used well these bins can generate more heat and so compost quicker than a wood slat bin. The downside is that they are tall with a narrower opening which means they are a bit awkward to mix your layers. Some people resort to lifting the bin off the compost, mixing it on the ground and then putting it back in.

Homemade bins, you can make bins out of posts and chicken wire, pallets or breeze blocks for example. All of these will work and they can be a great way to recycle materials you have to hand, just make sure they’re big enough to generate the heat.

Advanced composting. You may have seen insulated compost bins or compost tumblers, these work on the same principles and can reduce composting time significantly due to the high temperatures they reach or the easier mixing. If you really get into composting then give these a go, they do represent a bigger investment up front so maybe start with a simple heap to begin with.

Wormeries. A wormery is essentially a small compost bin filled with worms, you can use wormeries alongside your normal heap or instead of if you don’t have much space or are wanting to compost more of your food waste that you wouldn't put in a standard compost bin. Wormeries are particularly well suited to small gardens or flats with balconies as they don’t take up much space, produce small amounts of compost but lots of worm compost tea which can go on your houseplants or pot plants.

**Where to put your heap**

You can get a heap to work pretty much anywhere in your garden and they’re often tucked away in a corner out of sight, but there are two things to consider to help make your heap more successful. The first is temperature, they don’t like to get too hot or too cold, can dry out in full sun and might not get hot enough in full shade, so a spot that gets some sun during the day is ideal. The second is where will the majority of the contents come from and where the resulting compost is going to be used. You don’t want to be carting material from one end of the garden to the other if you can help it, you’re also much less likely to maintain your heap if it’s in a corner of the garden. So have it somewhere where it’s easy to fill up and maintain if possible.

**Managing your heap**

You can just add brown and green layers and eventually you’ll get compost you can use, however this will take a long time and there’s also a chance it won’t compost properly at all. You need to mix or aerate it every few weeks, this is for a few reasons: it ensures air gets into the compost which means it will break down properly and not smell, the drier outer edges get mixed in with the moist centre so that you get even composting, the greens and browns are also mixed so they complement each other. Do all of this and you will make compost a lot faster.

When you’re adding more material or mixing you can also take the opportunity to look at your heap to see if it’s too dry or wet, if dry then add some greens and/or water it, if wet then give it a mix and add some browns, cardboard will really suck up that moisture. A sniff test will tell you the same thing, if it smells a bit earthy or of plants then it’s okay, no smell and it’s too dry, smells a bit rancid or of ammonia then it’s too wet or not mixed.

Most of the time it’s also a good idea to keep your heap covered so that it has more constant temperature and moisture content. If it’s a bit dry and rain is forecast then you can leave uncovered, similarly if it’s wet and a dry, sunny spell expected.

**Problems and troubleshooting**

Common problems relate to an imbalance between greens and browns, moisture levels and mixing and these are described in *Managing Your Heap*.

Do not compost any grass clippings that have been treated with herbicides or weed and feed treatments, there are at least two long lived herbicides that do not fully break down in the composting process – clopyralid and picloram – sold under a number of trade names. There is a good chance the herbicide will be active and damage the plants you add the compost to. This is a great opportunity to go organic and stop using weed killers, your earthworms will be really grateful too.

Rats. It’s said you’re never far from a rat and a warm compost heap can be an attractive place for them to nest in. Here’s how to discourage them: don’t let your heap get dry, rats don’t like it moist, don’t put meat or dairy in your heap, keep mixing or turning your heap, they don’t like disturbance. There’s also anecdotal evidence that human wee is a turn off for rats, to do with territory marking, so another good reason to add wee to your compost.

Some perennial weeds shouldn't be added to your heap or they need to be treated in a different way. Common problem weeds include dandelions, ground elder, dock, nettles and bindweed, the leaves of all these are fine to add straight to your heap as it's the roots that are the problem. If you fill a bucket with water you can put these weeds in it (they must be fully submerged) and leave for a few weeks, this drowns the weeds and kills the parts that could regrow. The resultant weed slop can then be added to your heap. If you feel unsure about doing this then you can always put these weeds in your brown bin, the council composters get hot enough to kill all these weeds.

**Wildlife**

Once your compost heap is up and running all manner of creatures magically find their way in and make it home, they all play their part in breaking down the contents and a rummage through your heap can be fascinating. Get the kids involved, it can teach them a lot about what goes on in your garden and they can also go bug spotting. Why not have a compost safari?

So your heap is a habitat in its own right, which is really important as we face the loss in this country of 1 in 7 of our species, but you’ll also transfer some of those animals into your garden as you use your compost. This can be of direct benefit as you’ll boost the local worm population and they’ll work wonders for your soil, you may increase the numbers of predators that will eat common garden pests, but you will also provide a food source for other animals such as birds and hedgehogs. Starting a heap really is one of the best things you can do in your garden.
