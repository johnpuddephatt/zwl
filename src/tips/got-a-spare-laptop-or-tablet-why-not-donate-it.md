We chatted recently to Jack Simpson from [Hyde Park Book Club](https://www.hydeparkbookclub.co.uk/), about [Digital Access West Yorkshire](https://accesswy.org/) - a new project that's he's part of, which takes donated laptops and tablets and passing them on to people who need them in Leeds and Bradford.

Jack explained how Digital Access West Yorkshire was set up in response to the COVID-19 epidemic - to help to get laptops and tablets to people who need them - at a time when being digitally connected has mattered more than ever.  

The idea is pretty simple - you can [donate](https://accesswy.org/donate/) your laptop or tablet to DAWY - who will then wipe the machine's data - before passing it on to people who could benefit from it.  They work with local organisations - such as [LS14 Trust](http://www.ls14trust.org/) and [Seagulls](https://seagullsreuse.org.uk/) - to find people who can benefit from the donated machines.

There's more information on what they can accept on [their website](https://accesswy.org/donate/) - in summary they are looking for machines which work, are safe and run a minimum of Windows 7.  Ideally they should be under 5 years old.

Alongside donating a laptop or tablet, there are other ways to support their work - including by donating to their [crowdfunding campaign](https://accesswy.org/can-you-support-our-gofundme-campaign/) (to support things like buying data plans to help people to get online) - or by [volunteering](https://accesswy.org/volunteer/).

Or perhaps you could help by collecting a few laptops or tablets from friends, neighbours or work colleagues - like [Stuart Clarke from Leeds Digital Festival did recently](https://twitter.com/DawYorks/status/1271770430567854082)?

For up to date info on times you can drop off equipment at Hyde Park Book Club (currently 11-12 on Saturdays and Sundays), have a look at the [DAWY website](https://accesswy.org/donate/) - or [follow them](https://twitter.com/DawYorks) on Twitter.  

We think this is a great example of a grassroots project that is meeting a real social need - whilst also bringing important environmental benefits by keeping equipment in use for longer.

If you have electronic equipment to get rid of - that won't be of use to DAWY, there is more information about recycling electrical items in Leeds [here](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/how-do-i-recycle-electrical-items-in-leeds/).
