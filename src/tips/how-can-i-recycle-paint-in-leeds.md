If you have paint that could be used by someone else, local social enterprise[ Seagulls Paint](https://seagullsreuse.org.uk/) can take it for resale.

Under normal circumstances, you can [drop it at any of the Household Waste Sites](https://seagullsreuse.org.uk/paint/waste-sites/) for them to collect, for resale at[ their shop](https://seagullsreuse.org.uk/), just off Kirkstall Road. 

At the moment, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Seagulls are not in a position to collect paint from Household Waste Sites.  The containers where you can drop off paint for reuse are still operating - but they are likely to fill up quickly.

They have asked people to please keep hold of your paint for now - so that you can donate it to them for reuse [when they reopen - hopefully in June](https://www.instagram.com/p/CACeOpzn9jX/).  And don't forget to think of them first when you next need to buy some paint!

Here's a short film, premiered at last year's Leeds International Film Festival, that tells their story.
