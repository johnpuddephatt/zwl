It goes without saying that recycling plays an important part in helping us to waste less as a city.

Even allowing for what we talk about elsewhere – about the important of rethinking, reducing, repairing and reusing – it's vital that we do all we can to recycle materials that can then be processed and used again.

Recycling at home is the biggest way that most of us can make a difference. All the information about what can go in your green bin in Leeds is [available on the Council website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/your-bins), where you'll also find information about how to recycle other items that aren't currently collected from our homes, including glass.

Then there's also [the Leeds Bins app](https://odileeds.org/products/bin-app/) – a free app which was developed with the Council, which sends you reminders of which bin to put out when – handy for those of us who often forget!

We're also working hard in Leeds to make it easier for people to recycle whilst we're out and about – primarily through the [Leeds By Example project](/posts/leeds-by-example/), which was developed by environmental charity [Hubbub](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/leeds-by-example). If you're in the city centre, you won't be far away from one of our yellow or orange recycling bins – where you can recycle coffee cups, plastic bottles and drinks cans.  Leeds By Example was recently the lead story on BBC Look North - you can [watch it here](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/zero-waste-leeds-on-bbc-look-north/).  

If you think that recycling can sometimes be a bit confusing – particularly around things like which plastics can and can't be recycled – then you're not alone. One way to get answers to stuff like this is to [ask us](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/) – and if we don't know the answer, we'll ask on our Facebook page – and someone usually knows!
