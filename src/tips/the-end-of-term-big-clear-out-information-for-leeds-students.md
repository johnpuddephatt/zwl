Lots of students will be leaving Leeds over the next few weeks - and naturally there's potential - this year more than ever - for lots of food and other household items to get thrown away.  

Fortunately there's an excellent project in Leeds that's set up to deal with this - and we've shared information below - and on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/posts/798132990745226?__xts__[0]=68.ARC5q7wwFU4i623RDHKbEgMWazG-A18Ga8Q7CrN72tCYyQqCcG4-ULvUv4uTP_qQbvs0g9sJxmKPNJMDXSd1zvZakoRf2z3rYVcFfMr9ubAWjYdGXnUtv84A3iwEhSMVSZjTJQU9R7bJaGa9gd0Ngx2n1v1svdzrrnOg1iF-4i3ry9UwrgwgJkymIc2ApQfRclxoc7KBK4k0DDAyufqM3N0xRdnMI_kykVsFgef6w3OoAkw5UyDI1_fylq15olKz1yicKzAkAQMkFe1dvEs6GHs-F0CdHzKNdZyQjvOw3Dd9tgn6owJd8-YlTCR7EgWNz0eKcL9ra5TObynVUdyfad8&__tn__=-R). 

![Flyer with information about the Big Clear Out in Leeds](/uploads/bigclearout.png "End of Term Big Clear Out Flyer")

All the information is in [this flyer](https://www.facebook.com/hydeparksource/photos/pcb.1657888021041707/1657887337708442/?type=3&theater), but in summary:

You can fill **Blue Bags** - which have been delivered across Leeds 6 - with clean and reusable items such as clothing, paired shoes, books, small electrical items, pans and crockery.

There will be **door-to-door collections** of these Blue Bags on **16th, 23rd and 30th** of June - please leave Blue Bags by your door before midday.  You can leave extra items in strong, clear bags.  

For **small items of furniture** collections must be arranged directly by emailing [sustainability@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:sustainability@leeds.ac.uk)

Unopened, non-perishable, in-date food items can also be donated in this way - but in a separate bag or box from your other donations.

Blue bags can also be dropped off at the following donation points - [Cardigan Centre](http://cardigancentre.org.uk/), [Hyde Park Picture House](https://www.hydeparkpicturehouse.co.uk/) & [Gateway Church](https://gatewayleeds.net/) on **Tuesdays and Thursdays from 16th to 30th of June from 11-4pm**. 

If you have food - unopened, in-date and non-perishable - you can drop it off at [Rainbow Junktion](http://rainbowjunktion.org.uk/), [Gateway Church](https://gatewayleeds.net/), [Cardigan Centre](http://cardigancentre.org.uk/) or [Hyde Park Picture House](https://www.hydeparkpicturehouse.co.uk/) **on certain dates over the coming weeks**.  Please see [this flyer](https://www.facebook.com/hydeparksource/photos/pcb.1657888021041707/1657887337708442/?type=3&theater) for dates and times for each of them - or follow the [University of Leeds Sustainability Service](https://www.facebook.com/UoLSustainability/) on Facebook.  

Some local residents will also be accepting donations of unopened, in-date and non-perishable food - more information on this will be available on the [Headingley and Hyde Park News Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HeadingleyCouncillors/) page.

Until 5th of July [you can go to Kirkstall Recycling Centre](https://twitter.com/LeedsRecycles/status/1277552245857562624) without booking an appointment if you show your student card. You can go in a car or on foot,  - but no vans or trailers.  The address is [here](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites/kirkstall-road-household-waste-sorting-site) - and don't forget there is also a [Revive](http://www.reviveleeds.co.uk/) reuse shop here.  

More information can also be found on the Leeds City Council [website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/university-students).
