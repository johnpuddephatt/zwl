Glass isn’t currently collected from our homes in Leeds.  However there are more than 700 glass banks across Leeds.

You can find your nearest glass bank [here](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/where-i-live) (choose glass banks in the drop down list). 

The [Leeds Bins app](https://imactivate.com/leedsbins/) also lets you know where your nearest glass bins are.

There are also glass recycling bins at each of the[ Council’s Household Waste and Recycling Sites](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites).  There is currently an online booking system in place to visit the Sites - more information and the booking form is [here](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites). 

![Glass recycling update. During COVID19 you can still recycle your glass at sites across Leeds. Please don't make a special journey - but if you pass a glass bank during your daily exercise, or whilst doing essential shopping, please do recycle. Please follow guidelines on social distancing and keep 2m from other people. ](/uploads/glass-recyling-update.png "Glass recycling guidance during COVID-19")

Each year we recycle around 9000 tonnes of glass at recycling banks in Leeds.  But it's estimated that around 13,000 tonnes ends up in black bins each year.  That's the equivalent of 3 wine bottles in each household's black bin every fortnight.

The environmental impacts of not recycling glass are significant - and with the glass industry not currently getting glass from the hospitality industry, it's more important than ever that we recycle the glass we use at home - so that it can be turned into new products.

The glass you recycle in Leeds gets taken to a facility run by URM in South Yorkshire - where it is processed into "cullet" - to make new glass products.  BBC Look North recently followed the journey of glass recycled in Leeds to the recycling plant.  You can watch that [here](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/what-happens-next-to-the-glass-i-recycle-in-leeds/) - including an interview with Gill from Zero Waste Leeds.
