Have you ever wondered what happens next to the glass that you recycle in one of Leeds' 700 bottle banks?



We recently featured in a BBC Look North piece which followed the journey of bottles and jars that were recycled in Leeds - to a plant in South Yorkshire where they are processed - to be made into new glass products.

The amount of glass collected from glass banks in Leeds increased by 61% in May - compared with May 2019.  With us all at home more, consuming more, it's more important than ever that we recycle as much as we can.
