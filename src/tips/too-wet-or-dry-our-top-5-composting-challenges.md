**There’s so much information out there about composting and how to make it.  No one size fits all and different methods work for different situations.** 

**There are however some common challenges that all composters will face at some point in their journey.  Here are our top 5 and how to solve them.** 

### **Rats**

It’s said you’re never far from a rat and a warm compost heap can be an attractive place for them to nest. Here’s how to discourage them: 

\- don’t let your heap get dry, rats don’t like it moist, 

\- don’t put meat or dairy in your heap, 

\- keep mixing or turning your heap, they don’t like disturbance. 

\- there’s anecdotal evidence that human wee is a turn off for rats, to do with territory marking, so another good reason to add wee to your compost.

### Too dry or too wet

It's really important to balance  your greens and browns when composting, otherwise your heap can get too wet or too dry.  

Browns are things like cardboard, egg boxes, straw, hay, shredded paper, twigs, woody stems and bark/woodchip, they tend to be drier and contain lots of carbon. 

Greens are grass clippings, leafy or soft plant growth, veg peelings, tea leaves, coffee grounds and fruit, they tend to be wet and contain lots of nitrogen. 

Greens provide the moisture and energy for the bacteria (where you get the heat) and browns provide the structure and air, you want about a 50:50 mix of each.

To avoid your heap drying out or getting too wet, try these. 

\- always use a layer of brown and green in your heap. 

\- find the right spot in your garden or yard for your heap or bin (if possible).  Ideally put it in partial sun.  It can dry out in full sun and might not get hot enough in full shade. 

\- mix or aerate it every few weeks.  This ensures air gets into the compost which means it will break down properly and not smell, the drier outer edges get mixed in with the moist centre so that you get even composting, the greens and browns are also mixed so they complement each other.

### Garden chemicals

Do not compost any grass clippings that have been treated with herbicides or weed and feed treatments, there are at least two long lived herbicides that do not fully break down in the composting process – clopyralid and picloram – sold under a number of trade names. There is a good chance the herbicide will be active and damage the plants you add the compost to. This is a great opportunity to go organic and stop using weed killers, your earthworms will be really grateful too.

### **Weeds**

Some perennial weeds shouldn't be added to your heap or they need to be treated in a different way. 

Common problem weeds include dandelions, ground elder, dock, nettles and bindweed, the leaves of all these are fine to add straight to your heap as it's the roots that are the problem. 

If you fill a bucket with water you can put these weeds in it (they must be fully submerged) and leave for a few weeks, this drowns the weeds and kills the parts that could regrow. The resultant weed slop can then be added to your heap. If you feel unsure about doing this then you can always put these weeds in your brown bin, the council composters get hot enough to kill them.
