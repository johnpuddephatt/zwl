It’s important not to put **small electrical items** that are no longer working in your black bin or in your green bin.

![Please don't put small electrical items in your black bin as it could be a fire risk.  Use the map linked to in this article to find your nearest recycling drop-off point.](/uploads/weee.png "Please don't put small electrical items in your black bin")

\
They can present a fire hazard in the bin wagon - and throwing them away is also a waste of precious natural resources. Many small electrical items contain materials that - if they're collected for recycling - can be recovered and used again.\
\
So what can you do? [](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/electricals)[ There's more information on the Council website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/electricals) - including a map which shows where there are banks across Leeds for dropping off electrical items for recycling.\
\
[Household Waste Sites](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites) also have banks for small electrical items - but access to them is limited at the moment - with [an online booking system in place](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites).\
\
Longer term, there are plans in place to make it easier for you to return small electrical items to the retailer you bought them from.\
\
But for now you can either find a small electricals bank on the map, or wait until things go back to normal at the Household Waste Sites, and drop things off there for recycling.

If you have a **large electrical item**, such as a TV or washing machine, and it's still in good condition and in working order, then please think about donating it to a charity shop. There's [a list of some of the local charities that take items](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/get-rid-of-unwanted-items) (and which offer a limited collection service) on the Council website.   

None of these charities are currently open, but we will let people know when they're open for business again on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/).  

If you're buying a new item like a washing machine, it's worth finding out whether the retailer will take away your old item, either for a fee or free of charge.

Large electrical items can also be recycled at [Household Waste Sites](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites) - which are currently operating with [a booking system](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites) in place.  

A limited collection service will also be available from 18 May - but this is primarily for people who are shielding or self-isolating.  Information about the service - and how to book - will be shared [here](https://my.leeds.gov.uk/Pages/Form%20Pages/UnwantedItemsCollections.aspx).
